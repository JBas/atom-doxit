  "body": "# Welcome to the atom-doxit package website\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis is a very simple package to insert Doxygen comment templates, using the packages menu or a keyboard shortcut. Two types of comment can be inserted at the current cursor position:\r\n- file header comment: Contains file information (author, copyright, description, etc.)\r\n- function description comment: Contains basic details to describe the function.\r\nFields are automatically completed where possible (dates, author name).\r\n\r\n## Customisation\r\nThe author name must be configured in the package settings, otherwise the package will insert the default Joe Bloggs.\r\nThe keyboard shortcuts are configurable. Not much thought has gone into the default keyboards shortcuts, so it is recommended that these are set based on personal preference.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThis package was originally created by Cameron A. Craig (@camieac). Additional contributors will be added here as necessary (any help to improve the package is greatly appreciated).\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nIf you are having difficulty with the package, a [Github Issue](https://github.com/camieac/atom-doxit/issues/new) is likely to be the best solution. I can be contacted by email also. My email address should be visible on my profile page.\r\n",
